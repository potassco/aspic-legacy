#+Title Graph Coloring

* Aspic Invocation

** Default

   Launch aspic with

   % aspic ncoloring.lp

** Alternative Variant with Optional Command-Line Arguments
  
  Launch aspic with

  % aspic -n 10 ncoloring.lp graph2.lp

  with additional command-line options, such as the max numbers of
  models to compute ('-n <num>'), and an initial graph instance (here
  graph2.lp) to be loaded upfront. To get an overview of all available
  command-options run

  % aspic -h
  
* Exemplary Interactions:

** IULP15 Paper Example
   Load the example graph ('./graph.aic') and  execute a sequence of 
   state-changing commands and queries ('./query{1..5}.aic')  within 
   aspic by entering

   ?- load graph

   ?- load query1
   ...
   ?- load query5

** Other Example Interactions: run{1,2}.aic

   Sequence of state-changing commands and queries in './run{1,2}.aic',
   load within aspic via

   ?- load graph

   ?- load run1  (or ?- load run2)
