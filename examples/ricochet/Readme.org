#+Title Ricochet Robots Example

* Aspic Invocation
  
  Launch aspic with

  % aspic -c horizon=10 -n 6 board16-1.lp board16-ext-1.lp robots-direct.lp

  where cl options for the plan horizon ('-c horizon=<num>') and max
  numbers of models to compute ('-n <num>') can be customized.


* Exemplary Interaction
   
   1. Preparation: assert the initial robot position, here the ones
      from the original game are used by entering the following four
      commands:
      
      ?- assert pos(r,1,1)
      ?- assert pos(g,1,16)
      ?- assert pos(b,16,1)
      ?- assert pos(y,16,16)
      
      Alternatively to typing those in by hand, you can also
      automatically execute them by loading the corresponding script
      ./atpos.aic within aspic via

      ?- load atpos

   2. Queries

      * Single target
        ?- query target(blue,8,7)

      * Same coordinates, different colors
        ?- query target(red,8,11) | target(blue,8,11)

      * Same row 2 different color
        ?- query target(red,10,Y) | target(green,10,Y)

      * Same target coordinates for all 4 colors
        ?- query target(C,4,7) & robot(C)

      More queries can be found in script './q1.aic'.Simply uncomment
      the desired query and load within aspic via

      ?- load q1

   3. TBC
